You are modifying an existing hackathon website (friends → managers → chaos). Implement the following revisions cleanly. Keep behavior configurable via the existing config file. Do not hardcode timing/positions inside components.

========================================================
REVISION 1) Suggestions should happen even while typing
========================================================
Currently suggestions trigger only after typing stops (debounce). Change this so:
- After the user STARTS typing, suggestions can appear even while they are still typing.
- Do this without spamming: implement a configurable “typing suggestion cadence”, e.g.
  - minimum interval between suggestions while typing (e.g. 2–4 seconds)
  - optional probability per interval
- Keep the editor responsive; suggestions must not block typing.
- Keep the original debounce-based trigger optional via config (so we can switch modes).

Config additions (examples):
- friendsSuggestWhileTyping: boolean
- friendsWhileTypingIntervalMs: number
- friendsWhileTypingChance: 0..1

========================================================
REVISION 2) Chaos mode bosses can pop up anywhere, but must remain rejectable
========================================================
In chaos mode:
- Boss suggestion popups/bubbles may appear anywhere on screen (random positions).
- HOWEVER: ensure every bubble is always clickable and rejectable:
  - must not spawn under/behind the top bar / header
  - must not be partially off-screen
  - must respect safe margins from edges and UI elements
Implementation:
- Define a “safe area” rectangle for random placement:
  - exclude header height + padding
  - exclude bottom UI (if any)
- Constrain random x/y to safe area.
- Maintain a z-index high enough to be clickable.
- Each bubble must have a visible Reject button that always works.

Add config options:
- bossSpawnSafeMarginPx
- bossSpawnHeaderExclusionPx (or detect header height)
- bossRandomSpawnEnabled

========================================================
REVISION 3) Brainrot insertions should occur mid-typing
========================================================
Change sabotage timing so insertions/replacements can happen WHILE the user is actively typing (not only when idle).
Requirements:
- Use a timer that runs during typing sessions.
- Prefer small sabotage (short insertion/replacement) so it’s funny not catastrophic.
- Must remain undoable (Ctrl+Z).
Implementation guidance:
- Track “isTyping” state (based on recent keypress timestamps).
- If isTyping == true and in chaos mode, allow sabotage events at a configurable frequency.
- Optional: increase chance if user is typing fast.

Config additions:
- sabotageWhileTypingEnabled
- sabotageWhileTypingIntervalMs (range or min/max)
- sabotageWhileTypingChance

========================================================
REVISION 4) Time-check popup: next suggested time must be on a perfect 5-min mark
========================================================
In the chaos-mode time-check popup:
- The “current time” displayed must be real, live, and updating (HH:MM:SS).
- The “suggested start time” must be the NEXT time in the format:
  - HH:M{0 or 5}:00 (i.e., the next 5-minute boundary)
Examples:
- If current time is 15:43:37 → suggest 15:45:00
- If current time is 15:45:01 → suggest 15:50:00
- If current time is 15:59:59 → suggest 16:00:00
Implementation:
- Compute next 5-minute mark from Date() each time popup renders/updates.
- Suggested time does not need to tick every second, but must be correct based on current time.

Add config:
- timeCheckUpdateIntervalMs (e.g. 250–1000ms)

========================================================
REVISION 5) Spellchecker underline hover should behave like a real spellchecker tooltip
========================================================
The “correct spelling” underline feature must behave like a normal spellchecker:
- Underlined word shows a tooltip ONLY when mouse hovers over that underlined word.
- Tooltip text should include the specific word, e.g.:
  “✅ ‘accommodate’ is spelled correctly. Good job!”
- Tooltip should appear near the word (not fixed in a corner).
Implementation notes:
- If using a textarea with an overlay renderer, render underlined words as spans with:
  - blue underline styling
  - onMouseEnter/onMouseMove to position tooltip near cursor/word
  - onMouseLeave hides tooltip
- If using Monaco/CodeMirror, use decoration hover providers / hover tooltips.

Config additions:
- correctWordUnderlineChance
- correctWordMinLength
- correctWordTooltipEnabled

========================================================
DELIVERABLES / ACCEPTANCE
========================================================
- Suggestions can appear during typing (not just after).
- Boss bubbles can appear anywhere, but never behind header and always rejectable.
- Brainrot sabotage can happen mid-typing and is undoable.
- Time-check suggested start time always rounds up to next 5-minute boundary.
- Correct-word underlines show hover tooltips per-word like a spellchecker.
- All new behavior tunable via config + documented briefly in README (“How to tune” + “How to demo”).
