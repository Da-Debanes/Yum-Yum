You are modifying an existing hackathon website (React frontend, possibly Express backend) with “friends → managers → chaos” behavior. Implement the following changes cleanly and modularly. Do not hack features directly into components; use a config file + reusable components.

========================================================
1) Centralized Tuning / Parameters File (MUST HAVE)
========================================================
Create a single dedicated config file that controls key behavior parameters, e.g.
- typing debounce before friends send suggestions
- interval between suggestion attempts
- number of rejections before switching to managers
- chaos-mode popup cooldown
- sabotage frequency (if present)

Name suggestion: src/config/chaosConfig.(js|ts)

Also add a short README section “How to tune the app” that explains:
- where the file is
- what each parameter does
- an example change (e.g. reduce debounce from 1000ms to 400ms)

========================================================
2) Friends should respond faster
========================================================
Reduce the waiting time before friends start giving suggestions.
Use the config value from (1). The default should feel “snappy” (e.g. 300–700ms after typing stops).
Ensure suggestions do not spam: keep a reasonable cooldown/interval, also configurable.

========================================================
3) Manager Transition Animation Sequence (CINEMATIC)
========================================================
When switching from FRIENDS to MANAGERS, implement a short sequence:
A) A “phone call” animation: a phone icon goes to the friends/characters (can be simple CSS animation).
B) Screen overlay turns red.
C) Show a centered popup: “Managers to the rescue”.
D) Friends slide to the left and right edges (respectively) to make space.
E) Manager enters the scene from the bottom (slide-up animation).

Keep this as a small reusable “TransitionSequence” component (or similar), triggered once when phase changes.
Do not block typing permanently; sequence can overlay temporarily but should end cleanly.

========================================================
4) Chaos Mode: Editor Click Triggers Time-Gaslighting Popup
========================================================
In chaos mode, whenever the user clicks/focuses the textbox:
- Show a popup that includes the ACTUAL current time (HH:MM:SS).
- Message example:
  “Are you sure you want to work? It’s only 15:43:37. Let’s start at 15:45:00.”
- If user clicks “Yes”, show a second popup that escalates annoyance:
  “This does not pass the vibe check. Say ‘please’ at least three times if you really want to start work (not like it’s productive to start so early).”
Implement the “please three times” as a small input field in the popup:
- User must type “please” three times (e.g. “please please please”) to dismiss it.
- Make this whole behavior configurable (enable/disable + cooldown) in chaosConfig.

Add a cooldown so repeated clicks don’t fire popups every single time (configurable, e.g. 8–20 seconds).

========================================================
5) Avoid boss suggestions overlapping (NO OVERLAP)
========================================================
In managers/chaos mode, multiple boss suggestion bubbles must not cover each other.
Implement a layout system that:
- pins bubbles along the left/right sides (or side-ish)
- assigns each bubble a slot/position so they never overlap
- supports multiple bubbles on screen simultaneously without collisions

Implementation options:
- a “stacked lane” layout (left lane + right lane)
- or a simple grid/slot system with fixed vertical spacing
Choose a reliable approach; do not rely on random absolute positions that can overlap.

========================================================
6) Boss rejection feedback becomes more brainrot over time
========================================================
When boss suggestions are rejected, their response text should escalate in brainrot intensity.
Implement a “brainrot level” that increases with each boss rejection and affects:
- the wording of the boss’s follow-up messages
- optionally the frequency of popups/sabotage (if you already have sabotage)

Store brainrot content in a content file (not in components) and select based on level.

========================================================
7) Chaos Mode Easter Egg: Blue Underline on Correctly Spelled Word
========================================================
Sometimes in chaos mode (random chance, configurable), when the user spells a word correctly:
- add a BLUE underline to that word
- on hover, show a tooltip:
  “The word is spelled correctly. Good job!”

Notes:
- This is intentionally pointless.
- Keep it lightweight: do NOT build a full spellchecker.
- Use a simple heuristic:
  - choose a random recently typed word of length >= 4
  - treat it as “correct” if it matches a small internal dictionary list OR if it contains only letters and no obvious errors
  - then underline it and show the tooltip on hover
If your editor is a plain <textarea>, implement this as an overlay/highlight layer:
- render formatted text behind/above the textarea to show underlines, while textarea holds the real text
If you are using a rich editor (Monaco/CodeMirror), use its decoration API.

========================================================
DELIVERABLES / ACCEPTANCE
========================================================
- All new behavior is driven by the central config file.
- Friends respond faster (noticeably).
- Manager transition sequence is visible and polished.
- Chaos-mode focus popup uses real current time and the “please x3” gate works.
- Boss bubbles never overlap.
- Boss rejection messages escalate in brainrot intensity.
- Blue underline Easter egg appears sometimes and shows tooltip on hover.
- Provide brief notes in README: tuning + how to demo each feature quickly.
