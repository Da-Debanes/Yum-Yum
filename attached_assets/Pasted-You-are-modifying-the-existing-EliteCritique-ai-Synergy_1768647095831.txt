You are modifying the existing EliteCritique.ai / Synergy Docs hackathon web app. Prioritize a CLEAN, POLISHED DEMO. Keep changes modular and driven by config/content files where appropriate. Do not reintroduce coding-editor themes: this is an ESSAY critique parody.

========================================================
1) UNDO MODAL: rotate quotes + make it look “legit”
========================================================
Current issue: the Undo popup always shows the same hardcoded quote and looks too simplistic.

Implement:
- A list/array of “Undo wisdom” quotes (10–25) in a content file (e.g. src/data/undoQuotes.ts).
- Each time the user clicks Undo, randomly select a quote (avoid repeating the immediately previous quote if possible).
- Improve the modal UI to look like a real “writing assistant” panel:
  - Include a fake section header like “Revision Guidance”
  - Include a few hardcoded “analysis bullets” (not functional) such as:
    - **Key takeaway:** …
    - **Suggested mindset:** …
    - **Next step:** …
  - Add some hardcoded formatting elements: bold labels, bullet points, maybe a small “Tip” callout.
- Buttons:
  - “Accept reality” (closes modal, no undo)
  - “Insist on undo” (optional: after N insists allow a single undo OR keep refusing with escalating quotes)

Acceptance:
- Clicking Undo repeatedly produces different quotes and the modal looks more “product-like”.

========================================================
2) “CORRECT SPELLING” UNDERLINES LIKE GRAMMARLY (ANNOYING BLUE)
========================================================
We want the app to underline correctly spelled words (blue underline) just to be annoying.

Behavior:
- In essay mode, periodically choose some “normal” words to underline as “correct”.
- On hover over an underlined word, show a tooltip like a real spellchecker suggestion popup:
  - “Nice. You spelled ‘____’ correctly.”
  - “✅ ‘____’ is spelled right.”
  - Keep tooltip near the word, not in a fixed corner.

Implementation requirement:
- If editor is a plain textarea, implement a highlight overlay layer behind/over it:
  - Render the text with spans for underlined words.
  - The textarea remains the real input; overlay is visual only.
- Maintain correct caret behavior (do not break typing).
- Keep it lightweight: no real dictionary needed.
  - Simple heuristic: underline random words length >= 4 containing only letters.
  - Optional small allowlist dictionary.

Config:
- probability / frequency for underlining
- min word length
- max underlines at once (cap for clean demo)

Acceptance:
- User sees occasional blue underlines on normal words.
- Hover shows tooltip “You spelled this right” style messages.

========================================================
3) MANAGER TRANSITION: red flash FIRST, then humans slide out, then bosses slide in
========================================================
Change the transition ordering so the RED SCREEN FLASH happens BEFORE any character movement.

Sequence (STRICT ORDER):
A) Brief red screen flash overlay + centered text: “Managers to the rescue”
   - Duration ~400–900ms (configurable)
   - Optionally a quick “alarm” vibe animation (shake/fade)
B) After the red flash starts (or right after it ends), show a quick “calling…” moment:
   - e.g. phone icon shake near the humans OR “Calling managers…” badge
   - Duration ~300–700ms
C) Humans (friends/advisors) slide OUT to left/right
   - Duration ~600–1200ms
D) Boss characters (shark/plane) slide IN from the bottom
   - Duration ~600–1200ms
E) Remove overlays, resume normal UI

Implementation:
- Encapsulate this as a TransitionSequence component triggered once on phase change.
- Use a simple internal timeline (timeouts or animation callbacks) to enforce order.
- Must not permanently block typing; overlay can exist for ~1–2 seconds total.
- Keep it reliable and lightweight (CSS animations preferred).

Acceptance:
- Red flash + “Managers to the rescue” clearly appears BEFORE any sliding movement.
- Then humans slide out.
- Then bosses slide in.

========================================================
4) BRAINROT MODE: random suggestions + random brainrot typing into document
========================================================
In MANAGERS / chaos mode:
- Insert random “brainrot suggestions” occasionally (but not spammy):
  - Limit: at most 2 active boss suggestion bubble at a time (keep demo clean).
- Also: randomly start typing brainrot into the document while the user is typing:
  - small insertions (a few words) at cursor or end
  - must remain undoable (Ctrl+Z)
  - do not delete large chunks of text

Make it configurable:
- suggestion interval + chance
- brainrot insertion interval + chance
- maximum inserted length
- global caps: maxBossesOnScreen = 2, maxBossBubbles = 2

Acceptance:
- Boss suggestions appear sometimes, not flooding.
- Occasionally the document gets sabotaged with brainrot text.

========================================================
5) FAKE TOOLBAR BUTTONS (NON-FUNCTIONAL) FOR “LEGIT” LOOK
========================================================
Add a simple toolbar above the editor (if not already present):
- Bold, Italic, Underline, Bullet list, Numbered list
They do NOT need to work. They are purely cosmetic for the Grammarly-like vibe.

Acceptance:
- Toolbar exists and helps the UI feel like a real writing product.

========================================================
DEMO PRIORITY / ORDER OF WORK
========================================================
1) Undo quotes rotation + upgraded modal UI
2) Blue “correct spelling” underlines + hover tooltip
3) Transition sequence animation (red flash first, then humans out, then bosses in)
4) Brainrot random suggestions + random brainrot typing insertions
5) Add/adjust fake toolbar buttons

Keep everything clean, capped, and demo-friendly. Avoid spam and overlapping UI elements. Update README with “How to demo these features”.
