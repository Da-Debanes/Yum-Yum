You are building a hackathon website from scratch.

THIS IS A COMEDY / PARODY PROJECT.
The goal is to win “most annoying”, “most useless”, or similar hackathon awards.
Do NOT try to make this genuinely helpful.

====================
CORE IDEA
====================

The website contains a large textbox where users type essays or code.

The psychological goal:
Make the user feel like the smartest person in the room by rejecting mediocre advice.

The comedic twist:
After rejecting enough advice, intrusive brainrot “managers” take over and sabotage the experience.

====================
PHASES (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================

There are TWO main phases controlled by a state machine.

--------------------
PHASE 1: FRIENDS
--------------------
- Fake “friends” give suggestions via speech bubbles.
- Suggestions are:
  - technically reasonable
  - vague
  - mediocre
  - surface-level
- The user can click “Reject” on each suggestion.

On each rejection:
- The system responds with a subtle compliment like:
  - “Right, you probably already thought of that.”
  - “Fair, that might’ve been too basic for you.”
- The rejection count increases.

After ~4–6 rejections:
- Friends admit they can’t help anymore.
- Transition to PHASE 2.

--------------------
PHASE 2: MANAGERS (CORE COMEDY)
--------------------
- Brainrot “managers” appear (e.g. bombardino crocadilo).
- Managers are:
  - more confident
  - louder
  - more intrusive
  - much less helpful

Managers do the following:
- Interrupt with popups at random intervals.
- Gaslight the user about time:
  - “The time now is 15:43:32.”
  - “15:45:00 is a better time to start.”
- Give utterly useless, brainrot-filled suggestions.
- Occasionally sabotage the editor by:
  - inserting brainrot text
  - replacing a few recently typed words

Sabotage rules:
- Never delete everything.
- Must be reversible (Ctrl+Z or Undo button).
- Feels hostile but intentional.

====================
TECH REQUIREMENTS
====================

- Use a simple stack that works well on Replit:
  - Frontend: React (Vite preferred)
  - Backend: Express (Node)
- Backend and frontend can live in the same Replit project.
- One-click “Run” should start everything.

====================
ARCHITECTURE (DO NOT IGNORE)
====================

Organize code cleanly into:

1) Editor Layer
   - Textbox
   - Cursor tracking
   - Controlled text updates (for sabotage)

2) Chaos State Machine
   - States: FRIENDS, MANAGERS
   - Tracks rejectionCount
   - Controls escalation and behavior

3) Suggestion Engine
   - Generates suggestions based on phase
   - Does NOT directly manipulate UI

4) UI Layer
   - Speech bubbles
   - Popups
   - Buttons (Reject / Accept)
   - Annoyance meter (optional but encouraged)

====================
CONTENT HANDLING
====================

- All text content must be centralized in arrays:
  - friends suggestions
  - manager brainrot
  - compliments
- Do NOT hardcode text inside components.

====================
NON-GOALS (DO NOT DO THESE)
====================

- No authentication
- No database
- No productivity optimization
- No real “AI helper” behavior
- No overengineering

====================
DELIVERABLES
====================

1) A working website demonstrating:
   - Friends phase
   - Rejection escalation
   - Managers phase with popups and sabotage
2) Clean, readable code structure
3) A short README explaining:
   - the joke
   - how to demo it (reject advice to trigger chaos)

====================
IMPORTANT TONE RULE
====================

The system should sound:
- confidently wrong
- mildly condescending
- increasingly unhinged

The user should think:
“I’m clearly smarter than this system.”

Proceed now.
