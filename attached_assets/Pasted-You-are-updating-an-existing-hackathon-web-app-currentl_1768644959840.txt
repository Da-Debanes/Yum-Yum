You are updating an existing hackathon web app (currently “code/essay editor” with bosses/sharks/planes and chaos mode). We are PIVOTING the product philosophy and need a CLEAN, NON-SPAMMY demo.

HIGH PRIORITY GOALS
1) Pivot: NO coding editor, NO coding advice. This is now ONLY an ESSAY editor + “Grammarly-style” critique UI, but the critique is hilariously useless.
2) Make the demo clean: significantly reduce spam/popups. Chaos mode should be annoying but still watchable and not a clutter mess.
3) Keep the app feeling “smartest person in the room” in phase 1: it genuinely tries to critique, but fails in an overconfident way.

========================================================
A) PIVOT TO ESSAY-ONLY (MUST IMPLEMENT)
========================================================
- Remove all code-related language/UI:
  - “main.ts”, “code editor”, code-mode toggles, code-themed labels
  - any suggestions referencing scalability/web3/engineering/etc.
- Replace with an “Essay / Document” theme:
  - title like “EliteCritique.AI” can stay, but the editor is clearly an essay box
  - placeholder: “Start writing your essay here…”
  - word count, character count stay, but remove file-extension vibes (no .ts)
- Suggestion engine must ONLY generate “Grammarly-like” critique categories, but useless:
  Examples categories:
  - Clarity, Tone, Conciseness, Flow, Formality, Thesis, Transitions
  Examples useless critiques:
  - “Consider making this more ‘clear’.”
  - “The tone could be more tone-like.”
  - “Try adding a stronger transition… somewhere.”

Make this content-driven: update content files/arrays accordingly.

========================================================
B) MAKE THE START EXPERIENCE CLEAN + PROFESSIONAL (PHASE 1)
========================================================
The initial phase should LOOK like a polished Grammarly competitor:
- clean white/gray UI, professional typography
- subtle suggestion bubble style (less aggressive borders)
- suggestions appear at a reasonable cadence (not constant spam)

Keep “reject” and “apply”, but:
- rejecting gives morale-boosting messages (“you’re already ahead”, “fair, that’s too basic for you”)
- applying should still be useless (like replacing a word with a worse synonym)

========================================================
C) CHAOS MODE: REDUCE SPAM + LIMIT BOSSES
========================================================
Chaos mode is currently too spammy. Change it so:
- At any moment, there is at most ONE boss character on screen (one shark and/or plane at most).
- At any moment, there is at most ONE active boss suggestion bubble.
- Boss suggestion cadence should be slower and more deliberate (still annoying, but not flooding).
- Any time-check / popup should respect cooldowns so it’s not firing repeatedly.

Implement and enforce global caps:
- maxBossesOnScreen = 1
- maxBossBubblesOnScreen = 1
- popupCooldownMs increased (config-driven)

Update the spawn logic to respect these caps.

========================================================
D) UNDO BUTTON: “LIFE ADVICE” INSTEAD OF UNDOING
========================================================
When the user clicks the “Undo” button:
- Do NOT perform undo immediately.
- Show a modal/popup with life advice, e.g.
  “In life, there are no mistakes.”
  “Undo is a mindset.”
  “Reflection is the real rollback.”
- Provide buttons like:
  - “Accept reality” (closes popup, does NOT undo)
  - “Insist on Undo” (optional: after 2–3 insists, allow one undo OR still refuse in a funny way)

Keep this deterministic for demo:
- First click: life advice popup always triggers.
- Make behavior configurable via config file.

========================================================
E) CONFIG + DEMO POLISH (IMPORTANT)
========================================================
Ensure everything is tunable from the existing config file (e.g. src/config/chaosConfig.ts):
- suggestion cadence in phase 1
- rejections before chaos
- max bosses on screen
- max boss bubbles
- popup cooldowns
- sabotage frequency (if sabotage remains; keep it mild and essay-themed)

Update README:
- “How to demo”
  1) Type a sentence → get clean Grammarly-ish useless critique
  2) Reject a few → morale boosts
  3) Enter chaos → ONE boss appears, time-gaslight happens occasionally, not constant
  4) Click Undo → life advice popup

========================================================
ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
========================================================
- UI reads as an ESSAY editor, not code.
- Suggestions are essay-critique only, no coding references.
- Phase 1 looks clean/professional.
- Chaos mode is not a flood: max 1 boss + max 1 boss bubble on screen.
- Undo button triggers life-advice popup (clean + funny).
- Demo feels controlled and presentable.

Proceed by:
1) Updating content + labels to essay-only
2) Adjusting UI styling to “Grammarly clean”
3) Implementing boss caps and cooldowns
4) Implementing Undo life-advice modal
5) Updating config + README demo steps
